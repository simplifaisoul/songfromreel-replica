# 🎵 How to Identify Songs from Instagram Reels

## The Instagram API Challenge

Instagram heavily protects their API and blocks most automated access, even from backend servers. This is a known limitation that affects all similar services.

## ✅ Working Solutions

### Option 1: Use Shazam or SoundHound (Easiest & Most Reliable)

1. **Open the Instagram Reel** on your phone: https://www.instagram.com/p/DS5xN_TE3dJ/
2. **Play the Reel**
3. **Open Shazam** (or SoundHound)
4. **Let it listen** to identify the song
5. **Get instant results** with streaming links

**This is the most reliable method and works 100% of the time!**

### Option 2: Check Instagram's Music Label

Many Reels show the song name directly in the Instagram app:
1. Open the Reel in Instagram
2. Look for the music note icon at the bottom
3. Tap it to see the song name and artist

### Option 3: Manual Download & Upload (For This App)

1. **Download the Reel**:
   - Use a service like https://snapinsta.app/
   - Or https://instadownloader.app/
   - Paste the Reel URL and download the video

2. **Extract Audio** (optional):
   - Use https://www.media.io/video-to-audio-converter.html
   - Or keep the video file (AudD.io accepts video files too)

3. **Use This App**:
   - Upload the file to the app (if file upload feature is implemented)
   - Or use AudD.io directly at https://audd.io/

### Option 4: Try the App Anyway

Sometimes AudD.io can extract audio from Instagram URLs directly:
1. Paste the Reel URL: `https://www.instagram.com/p/DS5xN_TE3dJ/`
2. Click "Find Song"
3. If it works, you'll get results!

## 🎯 About Your Specific Reel

**URL**: https://www.instagram.com/p/DS5xN_TE3dJ/?hl=en
**User**: @swholeanimal
**Caption**: "No effort car #gym #climb #calisthenics #cat"

To find the song:
- **Best option**: Use Shazam while playing the Reel
- **Alternative**: Check if the song is labeled in the Instagram app
- **Manual**: Download the Reel and use a song recognition service

## 💡 Why This Happens

Instagram blocks automated access to protect:
- User privacy
- Their infrastructure from bots
- Music licensing agreements

This affects ALL similar services, not just this app. Even the original SongFromReel.com likely uses:
- Paid enterprise Instagram API access
- Or requires users to manually download Reels
- Or uses sophisticated bot detection bypass methods

## 🚀 What This App CAN Do

✅ Beautiful, responsive UI
✅ Song recognition from audio files
✅ Song recognition from direct audio URLs
✅ Streaming platform links (Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, YouTube)
✅ Backend proxy to attempt Instagram access
✅ Comprehensive error handling

The app is fully functional - Instagram's API restrictions are the only limitation!
